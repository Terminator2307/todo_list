 About:- to do list app that can save the tasks into local storage.
 Whenever user enters to the website, the tasks won't be lost unless clear local storage by clearing the history or doing something else.
 Here you manage your plans by adding task of the day.tasks completeed but still want to store in list (for once look at the end of the day) can mark as **Done** (button).
 and you wangt remove task from the list you can do by click on button **Remove**.
